abstract="Conventional access methods cannot be effectively used in large Scientific/Statistical Database (SSDB) applications. A file structure (called bit transposed file (BTF)) is proposed which offers several attractive features that are better suited for the special characteristics that SSDBs exhibit. This file structure is an extreme version of the (attribute) transposed file. The data are stored by vertical bit partitions. The bit patterns of attributes are assigned using one of several data encoding methods. Each of these encoding methods is appropriate for different query types. The bit partitions can also be compressed using a version of the run length encoding scheme. Efficient operators on compressed bit vectors have been developed and form the basis of a query language. Because of the simplicity of the file structure and query language, optimization problems for database design, query evaluation, and common subexpression removal can be formalized and efficient exact solution or near optimal solution can be achieved. In addition to selective power with low overheads for SSDBs, the BTF is also amenable to special parallel hardware. Results from experiments with the file structure suggest that this approach may be a reasonable alternative file structure for large SSDBs.",
